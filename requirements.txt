The project is to write a simple expenses tracker web application.
- User must be able to create an account and log in.
- When logged in, user can see, edit and delete expenses he entered.
- When entered, each expense has: date, time, description, amount, comment
- User can filter expenses.
- User can print expenses per week with total amount and average day spending.
- Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
- I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.
- Create a REST API for all user actions.
- In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
- You need to login to the application to enter expenses.
- User should be able to create an account in the system via an interface, probably a signup/register screen.
- You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
- TDD/BDD is a bonus
- You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible
